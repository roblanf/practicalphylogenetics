# Model Selection

There's a sometimes bewildering choice of models one could choose to use in phylogenetics, and an equally bewildering array of ways to choose between models. In this chapter, you'll learn:

1. What the models are, and how they work
2. The key assumptions that most models make about your data
3. How to select an appropriate model for your analysis using relative model selection
4. A range of techniques to assess whether your models are adequately describing your data
5. How to do relative and absolute model selection in IQ-TREE
